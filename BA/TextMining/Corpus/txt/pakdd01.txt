Abstract. In this paper we consider three alternative feature vector representations of patient health records. The longitudinal (temporal), irregular character of patient episode history, an integral part of a health record, provides some challenges in applying data mining techniques. The present application involves episode history of monitoring services for elderly patients with diabetes. The application task was to examine patterns of monitoring services for patients. This was approached by clustering patients into groups receiving similar patterns of care and visualising the features devised to highlight interesting patterns of care.
1 Introduction
We are interested in the problem of clustering individuals given observed data about the individuals where the observed data does not naturally occur in vector form. Clustering algorithms are typically applied to data in vector form. For example, we may have k-measurements on a set of patients and so the measurements on each individual i are represented as a k-dimensional vector. For vector-form data well-known and widely-applied clustering techniques can be applied. Such techniques are generally model-based methods include mixture modelling [6], or distance-based methods [3].
Much real world data is actually in non-vector form consisting of observations of an individual, recording information at particular time points. Such variable-length event sequence data is described in Sect. 2, but examples include a patient's usage of medical services and an individual's stock trading behaviour. The data is characterised as irregular events where each event may encapsulate a different type of action.
The data mining practitioner wishing to cluster event sequence data appears to have three options. The first option is to convert the event sequence data into feature vectors [4]. A problem with this approach is that information is inevitably lost in the vectorisation process. The second option is to use a distance-based clustering method which allows for non-vector data. An edit-distance metric [5] which uses insert, delete and replace operations to turn one sequence into another is an example of this approach. A difficulty here is in defining an effective distance metric. A suitable distance metric needs to be created for each new application. The third option is the use of mixtures of a generative probabilistic model [2, 1]. This is an attractive approach but not further explored here.

We chose the first option for the application described in this paper. An aim was to minimise the loss of information relevant to the data mining objectives in choosing the feature vectors. We present three alternative feature vectors for representing medical event sequence data. Our exploration provides insights into the process of developing alternative feature sets. We identify feature sets that are useful for clustering event sequence data.
Sect. 2 describes the patient health record data and Sect. 3 describes the objectives for investigating patterns of care received by patients. Sect. 4 describes the feature vectors we have used in looking for patterns of care. To the best of our knowledge two of the three feature vectors we use here are novel. Clustering results and their visualisations are presented in Sect. 5.
2 Health Care Data
Medicare is the Australian Government's universal health care system. Each visit to a medical practitioner or hospital is covered by Medicare and recorded as a transaction in the Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) database. This data has been collected in Australia since the inception of Medicare in 1975. Such a massive collection of data provides an extremely rich resource that has not been fully utilised in the exploration of health care delivery in Australia.
For this current exploration we use a subset of de-identified data (to protect privacy) based on Medicare transactions from Western Australia (WA) for the period 1994 to 1998. Our particular focus is on patterns of care related to diabetes for elderly patients (over 65 years of age). We have only limited demographic information about each patient, such as age, gender and location. For each patient we also have the sequence of diabetes-related monitoring tests they have received over this time interval.
The four monitoring tests included in our dataset are given in Table 1. Glycated hemoglobin measurements (Gl ) provide information about the accu-

Microalbuminuria tests (Al ) provide early indications of possible future kidney function loss.

3 Patterns of Care in the Management of Diabetes
An important area in health population research is the investigation of patterns of care received by patients. Are there distinct patterns of care for these diabetes patients? Are there groups of patients receiving similar patterns of care? Are the patterns of care related to their doctor? Do patients of different age or gender or location receive differing patterns of care to other patients?
We have some prior expectations about the desired patterns of care for elderly patients with diabetes. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) publishes clinical guidelines for looking after patients. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing complications such as eye problems, loss of kidney function and circulatory problems. The clinical guidelines recommend monitoring services, such as those in Table 1, be carried out at certain regular intervals. There is no compulsion for general practitioners to adhere to these guidelines and the guidelines cannot be expected to be appropriate for everyone.
To complicate matters, published clinical guidelines can differ in their details from state to state, and from country to country. We use the NHMRC guidelines as our starting point, but refer to other guidelines where they differ and where they may have an effect on clinical practice in Western Australia.
For example, according to NHMRC guidelines, glycated hemoglobin measurement should be done every six months (or every four months for some guidelines). Ophthalmologic examinations should be done every two years (or annually for some guidelines). The cholesterol measurement via lipid studies should be performed once a year. The microalbuminuria test should be done annually.
4 Selecting Features
We now present three methods for mapping the non-vector sequence data onto feature vectors. The first is the obvious count approach of having one feature for each type of service representing the number of times the service was used. The other two methods, which we call average-residual-deviance and the gap, are less obvious and overcome some shortcomings of the count method.

4.1 Count
In the count feature vector approach we have one feature for each type of service. Each feature contains the number of services received. The original sequence data, as shown in Fig. 1, is mapped to the features shown in Table 2. This
Patient Gl Op Ch Al 1 45 31 2 50 00 2 11 11 3 16 20 17 17

feature representation has the advantage of being easily interpretable. However the obvious loss of information is a concern for the goals of our project. We have lost information relating to the time between successive services and also to the overall coverage of the services across the five years. For example, an individual with a count of 15 for a service appears to be well-monitored, but if those 15 services all occurred in 1994 and none occurred in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, then that is a pattern we would like to identify.

4.2 Average, Residual, Deviance

We have devised the average, residual, deviance feature vector for capturing the
required temporal information missed by the count feature vector approach. Let tki,j(i = 1, 2, ...nj) be the date of the ith service for service type j on
patient k and nj be the total number of type j services received by patient k. Define Tf and Tl to be the beginning and ending dates of the time interval covered by the study.

Definition 1 (Mean Interval). The Mean Interval, M Ij,k, for the patient k on service j when nj > 0 is defined as :

M Ij,k =

nj -1 i=1

(tik+1,j

-

tik,j )

nj - 1

(1)

If nj = 0 then M Ij,k = Tf - Tl.

For example, we can calculate the Mean Interval for a patient who had thirteen tests for Quantitation of glycosylated hemoglobin on the following dates:

9044, 9272, 9377, 9527, 9592, 9766, 9875, 9985, 10101, 10154, 10334, 10413, 10510 (2)

where, for computational convenience, these dates are expressed as the number of days since January 1st, 1970. The interval (in days) between two consecutive tests are then

228, 105, 150, 65, 174, 109, 110, 116, 53, 180, 79, 97

(3)

have

M Ij,k

=

228+105+150+65+...+116+53+180+79+97 12

=

122.2.

Definition 2 (Deviation Interval). The Deviation Interval,DIj,k, for patient k on service j for nj > 0 is defined as:

DIj,k =

nj -1 i=1

(tki+1,j

-

tki,j

-

M Ij,k)2

nj - 1

(4)

If nj = 0 then DIj,k = Tf - Tl.

For example, using the patient with the health record for a single test given in Eqn. (2), the Deviation Interval is

(228 - 122.2)2 + (105 - 122.2)2 + (150 - 122.2)2 + ...

DIj,k =

= 47.9 (5) 12

Definition 3 (Residual Time). The Residual Time, RTj,k, for patient k on service j is defined as:

DIj,k = t1k,j - Tf + Tl - tknj,j

(6)

For example, using the patient with the health record given in Eqn. (2), we

have Tf = 8765 (January 1st, 1994) and Tl = 10592 (December 31st, 1997), so that the Residual Time is DIj,k = 9044 - 8765 + 10592 - 10510 = 361
The feature Mean Interval measures the average interval between receiving

the same service. The Interval Deviation measures whether the service intervals

are regular or irregular. The third feature provides a way of accounting for the

windowing effects of having data for 5 years only. The time interval from the

window boundary to the time of the first service and from the last service to

the window boundary are not considered in the definition of the first two feature

definitions. The third feature is used to account for these boundary effects.

The feature vector for a service should have reasonably small values for all

three features if the patient is treated according to the clinical guidelines. Typ-

ically, some patients do need more frequent services as their diabetic condition

is serious. We do not consider the possibility of over-servicing by medical prac-

titioners, where more services than are clinically necessary are provided.

Patterns of care contrary to the clinical guidelines can arise from insufficient

numbers of services provided over the five years. This type of pattern is detected

by the count feature vector and by a large Mean Interval value. The average,

residual, deviance feature vector also represents patterns of care where the ser-

vices provided are clustered in time, or are absent near the boundaries of the

time window.

The features are still relatively easy to interpret. However, we now need

twelve features in our present application instead of the four for the count feature

vector.

4.3 Gap

Our third feature vector representation is the most specific to the task of in-
vestigating service patterns with reference to service clinical guidelines. The
motivation is to describe the total length of time when the regular required tests
are not carried out. Once again, let tki,j(i = 1, 2, ...nj) be the date of the ith service for service
type j on patient k and nj be the total number of type j services received by patient k. Define Tf and Tl to be the beginning and ending dates of the time interval covered by the study.
We require that service type j have a desirable gap, DGj, as given by some clinical guidelines.

Definition 4 (Gap). If patient k has nj = 0 (the patient has no services) then the gap, Gj,k, is defined as:

Gj,k = Tl - Tf - DGj

(7)

If patient k has nj > 0 (the patient has one or more services)

Gjin,kitial =

tk1,j - Tf - DGj if tk1,j - Tf > 0 0 otherwise

(8)

The following counts the time intervals between services received:

Gji,k =

tik+1,j - tki,j - DGj if tik+1,j - tki,j > DGj 0 otherwise

(9)

We then include the final service interval:

Gfinal =

Tl - tnkj,j - DGj if Tl - tnkj,j > DGj 0 otherwise

(10)

The three Gap sub-parts are now summed:

nj -1

Gj,k = Gijn,kitial +

Gij,k + Gfj,iknal

i=1

(11)

For example, using the patient with the health record given in Eqn. (2), and
assuming that the DG1 = 120 for the Quantitation of glycosylated hemoglobin test (j = 1). As shown previously, Tf = 8765 and Tl = 10592. The Gap between Tf and the first test is 9044 - 8765 = 179 which is greater than DG1, so it contributes 179 - 120 = 59 to the sum. There are four time intervals exceeding DG1 among the 12 time intevals. They are 228, 150, 174 and 180 days respectively. Their contribution to the sum is 108, 30, 54 and 60 days respectively. The
last test was done on day 10510 and the gap between Tl and the last test is 10592 - 10510 = 82, which is less than DG1 and therefore contributes nothing to the sum. Therefore we have Gj,k = 59 + 108 + 30 + 54 + 60 = 311.
The advantage of this feature vector is that it is low-dimensional and easy
to interpret. This feature is particularly useful when there is an expectation of
regularity in the events and this regularity is to be explored.

5 Results
We used a model-based clustering program called Snob[7, 8] using a Bayesian mixture-modelling method with a Poisson distribution for the count feature vectors and a log-normal distribution for the average, residual, deviance feature vectors.
5.1 Clustering using Count
Fig. 2 gives the means and membership size of the 23 clusters found using Poisson mixture models. The Poisson distribution was suitable for these features because the counts are positive integers. Note that the counts are only approximately Poissson, because very large counts of services do not occur at all in practice. We now interpret these clusters. First recall that to receive care conforming to clinical guidelines for the Gl test over five years you would need between 10 and 15 tests. The population mean is 5 tests. It is apparent from Fig. 2 that most individuals do not receive conforming care because the large membership clusters (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7) have mean counts below 6. Only two clusters (e.g., 2 and 20) have means of 10 or more. Cluster 2 individuals do not conform on the other two tests because they have means less than 3 for Op and Cl. In contrast, Cluster 20 individuals receive better than conforming care for all three tests. The 70 individuals in that group are apparently better looked after than all the others. The next best groups for all three tests are clusters 15, 16 and 17.
In follow-up work we plan to examine the characteristics (e.g., number of GP consultations, whether they are in the community or a nursing home, number of days in hospital) of individuals in the very `good' and very `bad' clusters to see if they can be distinguished from those receiving other patterns of care.
5.2 Clustering using Mean, Residual, Deviance
Fig. 3 gives the means and standard deviations of the 17 clusters found using log-normal mixture models. The log-normal distribution was suitable for these features because the mean, residual and standard deviation have positive continuous values. A mean interval of six months or so is indicative of care conforming to clinical guidelines for the Gl test. Looking at Fig. 3 we see that clusters 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 and 17 have mean intervals less than 10. Cluster 17 has less than 10 members and so we ignore it for the moment. Individuals in clusters 8 and 9 receive the best patterns of care for this population. The 700 cluster 3 individuals receive regular conforming Cl tests, but very infrequent Op tests. In follow-up work we hope to characterise these individuals further. It may be possible to devise a policy to improve their quality of ophthalmology care. Opposite to cluster 3, clusters 6, 7 and 9 receive frequent Op tests, but infrequent Cl tests.
At the other end of the quality of care, the 850 individuals in cluster 16 receive less care than the other individuals in the population.

We now compare the clustering results from Fig. 3 with those from Fig. 2 using a confusion matrix. The ith row of the confusion matrix contains the members of cluster i using Count. The individuals of cluster i are placed in column j if they belong to cluster j using Average, Residual, Deviance. If the two clustering approaches were identical, then one would expect the confusion matrix to contain one non-zero entry in each row and column. If the two clustering methods are independent, then one would expect a relatively uniform distribution of non-zero entries.
The confusion matrix is shown in Table 3. We see that there are indeed many zero entries indicating that the two clustering approaches result in related, but not identical, results. Intuitively, we would expect this if very high residual values are rare, thus making the count feature values highly correlated with the average feature values. The most interesting feature is that we consistently observe that individuals from a count cluster are distributed among one, two or three average, residual, deviance clusters. On closer examination, the average, residual, deviance clusters have similar mean average and deviance values, but differ in their residual value. This shows the value of using the residual feature to identify intensive patterns of care during a relative short time interval.

5.3 Visualising the Gap
Fig. 4 provides a visualisation of the Gap for three different desired clinical guideline intervals (DG). The second of the three visualisations presents of Fig. 4 sets DG = 6 months. The distinct mode at zero indicates good conformance with the guidelines. In all three visualisations there is a mode around 20­24 months, worthy of further investigation: Is there some structural feature in the health system that has patients receiving this test every two years, rather than not at all (in the worst case). In general we note a peak at Gap = 0 and another

Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 provide a visualisation of the Op and Cl tests for two different published clinical guideline intervals. At the right extreme are the individuals who did not receive any tests and so do not conform to the guidelines. At the left extreme are those individuals who conform to the guidelines. In between we see how patterns of care slowly degrade in terms of conformity. Note the mode at 12 months on the left-hand side panels (where DG = 12 months). This is indicative of the population of individuals receiving a precisely conforming pattern of care.

6 Conclusion

We have considered three alternative feature vectors for representing variablelength patient health records. The feature vector of counts is the simplest, but can be misleading since it does not capture the distribution of patient care throughout the data window. The average, residual, variance feature vector overcomes this problem. For the specific task of characterising relationships to clinical guidelines, the gap feature vector most directly represents the required information. We expect the features created here for event sequence data for this health application will be applicable to other event sequence data such as trading and web log data.
