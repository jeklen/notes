More Data Than We Know What To Do With

Australian Health Transactions: 700 thousand per day Financial Transactions: 1 million per day? Telecom Transactions: 20 million per day?
Health Insurance Commission: terabyte data storage Australian Taxation Office: 24 databases, multiple tables

Drowning in the Data Stream

Stream Data:
Continuously becoming available Sequentially ordered arrival of data Generally arriving in quick succession Large amounts and perhaps limited storage Possibly distributed sources (e.g., sensor data) Foundation: database queries for data streams

How to Data Mine?

Moving Forward

Are we currently mining data in the best possible way? Using tools and techniques developed for different tasks? So far the track record is quite good, but . . . ? Should we take a fresh look at data mining . . . ?
